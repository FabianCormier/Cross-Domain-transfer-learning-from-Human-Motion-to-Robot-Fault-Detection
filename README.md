# ü§ñ Cross-Domain Transfer Learning: Human Motion to Robot Fault Detection

Welcome to the **Cross-Domain Transfer Learning** project, where we bridge the gap between human motion analysis and robotic fault detection. This repository provides a comprehensive approach to using advanced machine learning techniques, specifically LSTM-based residual models, to enhance robotic systems' reliability and performance. 

## üìö Overview

The goal of this project is to leverage human motion data to train a model that can detect faults in robotic joints. By preprocessing data, mapping human motion features to robotic contexts, and applying transfer learning, we achieve improved fault detection. The method incorporates:

- Data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare human motion data.
- Feature adaptation that aligns robot features with human-like patterns.
- Fine-tuning of LSTM models, which helps the model learn efficiently while maintaining earlier learned knowledge.

### üîë Key Features

- **LSTM-based Model:** The core of our approach is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, chosen for its ability to capture temporal dependencies in sequential data.
- **Residual Learning:** By employing residual connections, the model can learn better representations, improving fault detection accuracy.
- **Transfer Learning:** We utilize a transfer learning approach to apply knowledge gained from human motion data to robotic applications.
- **Class Weighting and Callbacks:** The evaluation process incorporates class weighting and callbacks for improved model performance.

## üìä Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FabianCormier/Cross-Domain-transfer-learning-from-Human-Motion-to-Robot-Fault-Detection.git
cd Cross-Domain-transfer-learning-from-Human-Motion-to-Robot-Fault-Detection
```

### 2. Install Requirements

Install the necessary packages. Use `pip` to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Data Preparation

Prepare your human motion data. Ensure that your dataset is organized correctly. Follow the guidelines provided in the `data/README.md` file for detailed instructions.

### 4. Training the Model

Run the training script to start training the LSTM model:

```bash
python train.py
```

Monitor the training process. The script includes logs that display real-time performance metrics.

### 5. Evaluating the Model

Once training is complete, evaluate the model using the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

The evaluation process will yield performance metrics and a feature importance analysis report.
